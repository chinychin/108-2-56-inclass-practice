## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
paste0(
  c("他叫","我叫"), c("小明","小美","大雄")
)
```

```{r}
example <- list(
  name=c("小明","小花","小新","美美"),
  height=c(175,166,170,160),
  weight=c(77,NA,60,43),
  birthday=lubridate::ymd(c("1998-03-11","1999-12-22","1995-08-22","2001-10-10")),
  hobby=c("美食 旅遊","旅遊 時尚","3C 美食","音樂 旅遊"),
  residence=c("Taipei","New Taipei","Taichung","Kaohsiung"),
  allowance=factor(c("0-1000","1001-2000","2000+","1001-2000")),
  bloodType=c("A","B","B","O")
)
```

```{r}
